This is a small PoC for stenography, it only allows for 24bit images. However they can be padded or unpadded.
You can hide shellcode or a portable exectuable.

there is UI for selecting text file for shellcode, or .exe/.dll/.sys, the application can be started by
drag and drop of a image or just starting it like regular.

the formatting of the shellcode must be this it does need to be 0xFF it can be FF
